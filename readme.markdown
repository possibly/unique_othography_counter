#Unique Orthography Counter

##Necessary Setup

Create a `songs` directory. For every song, create a file with the title and/or author of that song and simply paste the lyrics into that file. For example:
```
mkdir songs
cd songs/
touch 'never_gonna_give_you_up.txt'
[open never_gonna_give_you_up.txt and paste just the song lyrics in]
[save the file]
```

##Running the counter
```
python main.py
```
